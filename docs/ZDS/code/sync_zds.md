# Sync ZDS

[back](./readme.md)

**This is SIA Amsterdam specific code**

This management command takes care of 2 things.
1. Sending all old `meldingen` to the `ZDS components`
2. Making sure that all `meldingen` are send completely to the `ZDS components`

This is also only making use of the `tasks.py` to send data to the `ZDS components`
