# ZDS 2.0 koppeling

Early 2019 a collabration between VNG and SIA resulted in the ZDS 2.0 koppeling.

The ZDS implementation is not maintained and got out of date. It was never taken into use on the 
production environment of SIA. And was ony used as a proof of concept of this collabration.

Therefore we removed the implementation from the master branch. 

We decided to keep te implementation in a separate protected branch for archiving purposes. 
This branch can be found at https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals/tree/feature/zds
